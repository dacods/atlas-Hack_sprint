## Two Dudes, Two Games

A collaborative effort to make two 2D story games inspired by classic fairytales. This project aims to create a story driven experience with fairly engaging gameplay.
## Project Structure
Rapunzel's Key: A game inspired by the Rapunzel fairytale. The player is tasked with ultimately one goal, read the fairytale locked in the chest!

Hansel's Mission: Inspired by the fairytale Hansel and Gretel. Gretel is taken by a witch. As the player you are put in Hansel's shoes and must defeat the witch to get your sister Gretel back. 
## Features

- Two Games: Explore two different fairytales each with their own "storylines"
- Collaborative Development: Developed by Braden Chance and Dacoda Takagi, leveraging individual skills and visions.
- Pixel Art: Both games showcase pixel art graphics, capturing the nostalgic aesthetic of some of our favorite games.
